**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Golang simulation of [knight's tour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour), a sequence of moves of a knight on a chessboard such that the knight visits every square exactly once.

## Solving Knight Tour Problem

### First naive implementation

* Random move: no strategy for moves,
* Single pass: no backtracking
* No solution: reaches blocking situation before solving the problem
